# Customer-Churn-Prediction
In this Project, I analyze Credit Card Customer Dataset through univariate and Bivariate analysis.
Also applied Statistical Test like Pearson correlation, ANOVA and Chi-square Test of Independence to identify the relation between different features.
For solving Class Imbalance I applied Smote and then applied various ML models to predict the churn.
